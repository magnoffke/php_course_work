<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Maggie and Jereme Noffke have been collecting vinyl separately for nearly 10 years, and together for seven. It all began when Jereme purchased a collection from a garage sale. We needed something so we could listen to the vinyl. Maggie gave Jereme a record player upgrade for one of the very first birthdays he had they were together.</p>

<p>The Noffke's live in Madison, WI. They mostly purchase their records at any of the three local independent music stores. No matter what city they visit, they find a local shop to browse the new and used collections. They've also been known to purchase hard-to-find records online.</p>

<p>Not only do they enjoy listening to music in nearly every room of their house, they enjoy going to live shows as well. You might see them down at The Majestic, The High Noon Saloon, The Barrymore, or at The Orpheum in Madison on any given weekend.</p>
